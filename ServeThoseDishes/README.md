# Serve Those Dishes

Adds a task for meat-bags to bring food to the dish counters, and not lazily leave it in storage.

Dish Counters work as "drop-off" points for food dishes, meaning it seems they were only checked when initially attempting to find a place to put a newly created dish. 

Note: You may need to click "shutdown" on and off for the dish counters, for the crew to properly notice the new task.
